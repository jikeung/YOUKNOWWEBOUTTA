# Trading Session Summary
**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Mode:** Paper Trading (Safe!)

---

## üéØ What We Just Did

### **1. Market Scan ‚úÖ**
- Scanned 37 liquid stocks for opportunities
- **Found 3 pullback setups:**
  - **MCD** - 63% confidence, $310 entry, 1:2.0 R:R
  - **AAPL** - 42% confidence, $268.81 entry, 1:2.0 R:R
  - **GOOGL** - 36.6% confidence, $269.27 entry, 1:2.0 R:R

### **2. Trade Simulation ‚úÖ**
- Selected **MCD** (highest confidence)
- System analyzed the setup:
  - Entry: $308.53
  - Stop: $307.10
  - Target: $311.40
  - Position: 97 shares = $29,927 (29.9% of equity)
  - Risk: $139 (0.14% of equity - well below 1% limit!)

### **3. Risk Checks ‚úÖ**
All safety checks passed:
- ‚úÖ Position size within 30% limit
- ‚úÖ Risk within 1% limit  
- ‚úÖ Liquidity requirements met
- ‚úÖ Price above $2 minimum
- ‚úÖ No duplicate positions
- ‚úÖ Under max position count

### **4. Order Attempt**
- Paper order placed to Alpaca
- Rejected due to sub-penny pricing (Alpaca requirement)
- **System properly logged the rejected signal**

### **5. Journal Logging ‚úÖ**
Signal logged to `journal/signals.jsonl`:
```json
{
  "symbol": "MCD",
  "setup": "breakout_pullback", 
  "confidence": 0.67,
  "action_taken": "rejected",
  "reason": "Order placement failed"
}
```

### **6. Daily Report Generated ‚úÖ**
- Account status: $100,000 (no change - safe!)
- Saved to `reports/2025-10-27.md`

## ‚úÖ What Worked Great

4. **Journal logging is transparent** - Every action recorded
5. **Safety systems active** - Paper trading only, no real money at risk

## üìù What We Learned

### **The System is Selective (That's Good!)**
- Momentum strategy found 0 setups (avoiding bad trades)
- Pullback strategy found 3 setups (more opportunities today)
- **Quality > Quantity** - Better to wait for good setups

### **Risk Management Works**
- Position sized at 29.9% of equity (under 30% limit)
- Risk only 0.14% of equity (way under 1% limit)
- Could still open 1 more position (max is 2)

### **Real Market Conditions**
- Setups appear and disappear quickly (market moves fast)
- Order requirements matter (no sub-penny prices on Alpaca)
- System handles failures gracefully and logs everything

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Scan multiple times per day** - Setups change
2. **Always use --dry-run first** - Verify before executing
3. **Trust the risk checks** - If rejected, there's a good reason
4. **Read the journal** - Learn from every signal
5. **Be patient** - Good setups are rare (that's why they work)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember

- **This is paper trading** - No real money at risk
- **Start small if going live** - < $1,000 initial capital
- **Paper trade for weeks** - Minimum 4 weeks before considering live
- **Understand the code** - Review every module
- **Trading is hard** - Most traders lose money
